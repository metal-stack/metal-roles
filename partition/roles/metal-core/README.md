# metal-core

Deploys metal-core in a systemd-managed Docker container.

This role can deploy on switches running Cumulus Linux or SONiC. It depends on the `switch_facts` module from `ansible-common`, so make sure modules from `ansible-common` are included before executing this role.

## Variables

This role uses variables from [partition-defaults](/partition). So, make sure you define them adequately as well.

You can look up all the default values of this role [here](defaults/main/main.yaml).
