# headscale

This role deploys a headscale server into the control plane. It is an optional component for deployment and can be used to access firewalls through a VPN mesh such that there is no need for open SSH ports anymore.

This role just wraps the [postgres-backup-restore](/control-plane/roles/postgres-backup-restore) role. Refer to this role for further documentation.

If you want to rotate the API key, you need to delete the `headscale-api-key` secret and re-run the deployment.

## Variables

The role should take the same variables as the wrapped role, but prefixed with `headscale_db_` instead of `postgres_`.
